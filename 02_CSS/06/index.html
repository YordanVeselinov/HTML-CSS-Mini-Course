                    Hyper is the opposite of linier. It used to be that computer programs had to move in a linear fashion. This before this, and so on. HTML does not hold to the pattern and allows the person viewing the World Wide Web page to go anywhere, any time they want.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Text is what you will use. Real, honest to goodness English letters.

                Alt-text is not a description of an image, but a replacement for the image in case it is not displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
            An ampersandd character "&" must be always be escaped like this: "&" - even in URLs.
